## KNEX

npx knex migrate:make <migration-name>

npx knex migrate:latest

## Docker

### Local

`docker build -t app .`

`docker run -p 8080:80 app`

## Database

There is an issue with knex and migration names. Knex stores the file extension in the table, so there is a problem on running knex in a production build because migrations are in `js` and not in `ts` as it is on development. To solve that, a `migrationSource` was created but it's needed to update the table on DB `knex_migrations` removing the extension;
